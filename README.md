- Git | To clone this project from GitHub | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- pip (comes with Python) | To install Python packages | Installed with Python
- Virtual Environment (venv) | For clean dependency management | `python -m venv venv`

These instructions will help you run the Smart Career Companion app on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/smart-career-companion.git
cd smart-career-companion
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys & Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project’s root directory:
```bash
touch .env  # (type in cmd or terminal)
```
Inside `.env`, add your private keys and configuration:
```ini
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
```

💡 **Alternative:**  
If you prefer, you can create a sample config file:  
`instance/config.py.example`  
And write:

```python
FLASK_APP = "app.py"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_key"
RAPIDAPI_KEY = "your_rapidapi_key"
```

### 5. Initialize the database
```bash
flask db init      # (only the very first time)
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

This will create your SQLite DB and apply all Alembic migrations.

### 6. Run the application
```bash
flask run
```
